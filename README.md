My implementation of the Monkey language in rust

This is designed to help me to learn how programming languages are implemented, following [Writing An Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/). Note that for the most part, this follows the code in the book quite literally, unless there is something that I think could be replaced to be more idiomatic (For example, using `enum`s instead of string literals to differentiate token types).
